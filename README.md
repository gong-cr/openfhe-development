PALISADE supports the following:

* Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
   * Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme for integer arithmetic
   * Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme for integer arithmetic
   * Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme for real-number arithmetic
   * Ducas-Micciancio (FHEW) and Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachene (TFHE) schemes for Boolean circuit evaluation
* Multi-Party Extensions of FHE (to support multi-key FHE)
   * Threshold FHE for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
   * Proxy Re-Encryption for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
